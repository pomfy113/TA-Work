I treated this more of a 'someone can come in, look at the code, and understand'. While it's not polished and fleshed out, I kept complexity low to make it easy to follow. I'm not sure how good it looks since I'm not used to teaching, but I hope it does its purpose well.

I did avoid using specific movie API just to make it easier to follow.

Maybe I should have a testing bit to show people how tests work?
